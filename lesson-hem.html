      <h2>Opening: Why This Story Matters</h2>
      <div class="story">
        <p>
          This is not a story about rules.<br/>
          This is not a story about shame.<br/><br/>
          This is a story about a woman who reached and a Jesus who stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          For twelve years, her body betrayed her. For twelve years she learned to disappear, to stay low, to move in the background.
          And yet… something in her still believed:<br/>
          <em>“If I can just touch Him…”</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Story -->
    <section>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <div class="story">
        <p>
          The Gospels tell us about a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="mark52534">Mark 5:25–34</span>;
          also <span class="verse-link" data-verse="matt92022">Matthew 9:20–22</span>;
          <span class="verse-link" data-verse="luke84348">Luke 8:43–48</span>).
          Her condition made her ceremonially unclean, socially isolated, and spiritually excluded.
        </p>

        <h3>1. She Learned to Live Low</h3>
        <p>
          For twelve years, she lived in a body that betrayed her. Quietly, the messages stacked up in her soul:
          <br/>• You are unclean.
          <br/>• You should stay back.
          <br/>• You don’t belong in the middle of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          So she learned to stay low. To move through crowds without being seen. To keep her eyes down. To take up as little space as possible.
          Society placed her in the dust and over time, she believed that’s where she belonged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet somewhere inside her, hope survived:<br/>
          <em>“If I can just touch Him…”</em><br/>
          Not ask. Not speak. Just reach.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Jesus Was On His Way to Someone “Important”</h3>
        <p>
          Jesus wasn’t wandering that day. He was walking with purpose –
          a respected synagogue leader, a dying child, a crisis everyone agreed mattered
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="mark52124">Mark 5:21–24</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Time was precious. Eyes were watching. And yet, from the dust, from the place women were taught to remain, a hand reached out.
          She didn’t reach from confidence. She reached from desperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          She reached for the hem – the lowest part of Him – because it felt like the highest place she was allowed to be
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="mark527">Mark 5:27</span>).
        </p>
        <div class="reflection">
          <strong>Reflection</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Have you ever felt like others’ needs mattered more than yours?</li>
            <li>Where are you reaching from right now – exhaustion, shame, fear, hope?</li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <h3>3. Power Moved Because Faith Reached</h3>
        <p>
          The moment she touched Him, her body changed. Scripture says:
          <em>“Immediately… she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.”</em>
          and <em>“Jesus… knew that power had gone out of Him.”</em>
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="mark52930">Mark 5:29–30</span>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the quiet truth we often miss:<br/>
          Jesus did not stop, choose her, and then heal her.<br/>
          Her faith reached and power responded.<br/>
          She was healed by her faith, faith that reached even while she believed she didn’t belong.
        </p>
        <div class="reflection">
          <strong>Reflection</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>What does this teach you about faith?</li>
            <li>Where is Jesus inviting you to reach, not only wait?</li>

        <h3>4. Jesus Stopped. Not to Shame Her, but to See Her</h3>
        <p>
          Jesus stopped the crowd. Not to correct her. Not to expose her as a rule-breaker. Not to embarrass her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hidden healing was never the end of His plan.
          She came forward trembling, still low, still afraid, still in the dust
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="mark533">Mark 5:33</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
          And instead of rebuke, He spoke one word that lifted her:
          <em>“Daughter.”</em>
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="mark534">Mark 5:34</span>)
        </p>
        <div class="reflection">
          <strong>Reflection</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you imagine she felt when He called her “daughter”?</li>
            <li>What names have you carried that Jesus wants to replace?</li>
          </ul>
          <label class="label">My Answer</label>
          <textarea class="reflection-answer" data-ref="4" placeholder="Write your response to these questions..."></textarea>
        </div>

        <h3>5. “Daughter” Is More Than a Word</h3>
        <p>
          This was not a soft, sentimental moment. In that culture, “daughter” meant:
          <br/>• You belong.
          <br/>• You are protected.
          <br/>• You have a place.
        </p>
        <p>
          By calling her daughter, Jesus restored her dignity, her belonging, and her place in front of everyone.<br/>
          She was no longer “the unclean woman”. She was family.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then He said: <em>“Your faith has made you well.”</em> Not “my power”, not “my touch”  <strong>your faith</strong>.
          (<span class="verse-link" data-verse="rom815">Romans 8:15</span> reminds us we receive the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba, Father.”)

        <h3>6. What This Means for Us</h3>
        <p>
          Sisters, this story is ours.<br/>
          Some of us are reaching from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>exhaustion</li>
          <li>shame</li>
          <li>single motherhood</li>
          <li>disappointment</li>
          <li>feeling overlooked or forgotten</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We reach quietly. We reach unsure. We reach hoping no one notices.<br/>
          And still… Jesus stops.<br/>
          He is never too busy. He is never too important. He is never rushing past your faith.<br/>
          And He still calls us: <strong>Daughter</strong>.
        </p>

      <h2>Devotional: “If I Could Just Touch the Hem”</h2>
      <div class="story">
        <p>
          She does not speak. She does not ask. She does not announce herself. She simply reaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          For twelve years, her body has betrayed her. For twelve years, hope has been postponed. For twelve years, she has learned how to disappear.
          And yet… something in her still believes. Not loudly. Not confidently. But quietly enough to move her feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          She does not reach for His hand. She does not lift her eyes to His face. She reaches for the lowest part of Him, the hem.
          The place closest to the dust. The place nobody notices. The place she feels she belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Jesus lets her touch Him. Power flows, not because He planned a public miracle, but because love responds to faith.
          Her body knows before her mind can explain it. The bleeding stops. But Jesus stops too.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, her greatest fear becomes reality: she is seen. The crowd pauses. The disciples are confused. Her heart is racing.
          This is the moment shame usually takes over.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jesus does not speak shame. He speaks family.<br/>
          Not “woman”. Not “unclean”. Not “you shouldn’t have”.<br/>
          <strong>Daughter.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In one word, He gives her back her dignity, her belonging, her name. She came for healing. She received restoration.
        </p>
        <p>
          And maybe that’s the part we miss.<br/>
          Jesus could have let her walk away quietly healed. But He wanted her to know:<br/>
          <em>You are not healed because you were sneaky. You are healed because you are Mine.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of us are still reaching like her. Not boldly. Not publicly. But sincerely.
          Touching Jesus in whispered prayers. In tearful moments alone. In desperate faith that says,
          “I don’t need to be seen. I just need You.”<br/>
          And Jesus sees you anyway.<br/>
          He always has.
